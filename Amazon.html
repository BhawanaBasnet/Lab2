	<p>Amazon.com, is an American multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The company has been referred to as "one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world", as well as the world's most valuable brand.</p>

    <p>Jeff Bezos founded Amazon from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[15] on July 5, 1994. It started as an online marketplace for books but expanded to sell electronics, software, video games, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. In 2015, Amazon surpassed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the United States by market capitalization.[16] In 2017, Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market for US$13.4 billion, which substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[17] In 2018, its two-day delivery service, Amazon Prime, surpassed 100 million subscribers worldwide.</p>

    <p>Amazon is known for its disruption of well-established industries through technological innovation and mass scale. It is the world's largest online marketplace, AI assistant provider, live-streaming platform and cloud computing platform as measured by revenue and market capitalization. Amazon is the largest Internet company by revenue in the world.[24] It is the second largest private employer in the United States[25] and one of the world's most valuable companies. As of 2020, Amazon has the highest global brand valuation.</p>


	 <p> HISTORY</p>
	 <p>Jeff Bezos founded Amazon in July 1994. He chose Seattle because of technical talent as Microsoft is located there. Mackenzie Scott played a big role in the founding of Amazon and drove across the country with Jeff to start it. After Scott graduated, she applied to work for D. E. Shaw, a quantitative hedge fund in New York City, as a research associate to "pay the bills while working on her novels". She was interviewed by Jeff Bezos, who was then a vice-president at the firm. The interview was her first meeting with him.</p>

     <p>In May 1997, Amazon went public. It began selling music and videos in 1998, at which time it began operations internationally by acquiring online sellers of books in United Kingdom and Germany. The following year, Amazon began selling items including video games, consumer electronics, home improvement items, software, games, and toys.</p>
